=== Advanced Configuration
The plugin uses "facets" to describe what rules to add to the .gitignore file. These facets correspond to the technology
selections on the gitignore.io website.

When using advanced configuration the plugin will continue to automatically discover project facets, but you are also
able to add your own facets to the generation process by using the `facets` configuration parameter.
